## Part-I: Two systems

### Summary

[Write a brief summary of the chapter here]

### Key Points
#### Ch 1: The Characters of the Story
- System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.
- System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.
- System 2 can modify System 1 by programming attention and memory.
- System 1 operates automatically, while System 2 typically works in a low-effort mode.
- System 1 generates suggestions for System 2, which can become beliefs or actions if endorsed.
- System 1 calls on System 2 for detailed processing when needed.
- System 2 monitors behavior, maintaining politeness when angry and alertness while driving.
- System 2 is too slow to replace System 1 but can help avoid mistakes when necessary.

#### Ch 2: The Characters of the Story
- Pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort.
- System 2 can adopt "task sets" to override habitual responses.
- The most effortful slow thinking requires fast thinking.

#### Ch 3: The Lazy Controller
- System 2 has a natural speed and expends energy on random thoughts and monitoring without much strain.
- Self-control and cognitive effort are forms of mental work. Studies show people facing both a demanding cognitive task and temptation are more likely to yield to temptation.
- People who are cognitively busy are also more likely to make selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgments in social situations. 
- Self-control is tiring; after forcing yourself to do something, you're less able to exert self-control on the next challenge (ego depletion).
- High-demand System 2 activities require self-control, which is depleting and unpleasant. Ego depletion involves a loss of motivation, making it harder to exert self-control again.
- Stanovich argues that rationality should be distinguished from intelligence.

#### Ch 4: The Associative Machine
- An odd feature is that your System 1 treated the mere conjunction of two words as reality (banana, vomit). Your body reacted as if to the real thing, with emotional and physical responses forming part of the interpretation.
- In the current view of associative memory, an activated idea triggers many others simultaneously, which then activate even more ideas.
- Only a few activated ideas reach consciousness; most associative thinking occurs silently and unconsciously.
- It's hard to accept, but true: you know far less about yourself than you feel you do because much of your mind's workings are hidden from your experience.
- Influencing of an action by the idea—is known as the ideomotor effect. The ideomotor link also works in reverse.
- System 1 provides the impressions that often turn into your beliefs, and is the source of the impulses that often become your choices and your actions. It offers a tacit interpretation of what happens to you and around you, linking the present with the recent past and with expectations about the near future. It is the source of your rapid and often precise intuitive judgments.

#### Ch 5: Cognitive Ease
- One of the dials measures cognitive ease, ranging from "Easy" to "Strained." "Easy" indicates smooth functioning with no threats or major news, requiring no redirection of attention or effort. "Strained" signals a problem, necessitating increased mobilization of System 2.
- A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth.
- The familiarity of one phrase in a statement can make the entire statement feel familiar and true. If you can't remember the source of a statement and can't relate it to other knowledge, you rely on cognitive ease.
- In order to make people to believe you the general principle is that anything you can do to reduce cognitive strain will help, so you should first maximize legibility.
- System 1 can respond to events unknown to System 2. The mere exposure effect is stronger for stimuli never consciously seen by the individual.
- The evidence linking good feelings, cognitive ease, and the intuition of coherence is correlational. Despite this, good feelings do lead to intuitions of coherence.
