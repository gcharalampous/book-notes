## Part-I: Two systems

### Summary

In summary, Chapter 1 effectively lays the foundation for understanding the dual processes of the human mind. It invites readers to be more mindful of their thinking patterns and the potential for cognitive errors, encouraging a more deliberate and reflective approach to decision-making.

### Key Points
#### Ch 1: The Characters of the Story
- System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.
- System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.
- System 2 can modify System 1 by programming attention and memory.
- System 1 operates automatically, while System 2 typically works in a low-effort mode.
- System 1 generates suggestions for System 2, which can become beliefs or actions if endorsed.
- System 1 calls on System 2 for detailed processing when needed.
- System 2 monitors behavior, maintaining politeness when angry and alertness while driving.
- System 2 is too slow to replace System 1 but can help avoid mistakes when necessary.

#### Ch 2: The Characters of the Story
- Pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort.
- System 2 can adopt "task sets" to override habitual responses.
- The most effortful slow thinking requires fast thinking.

#### Ch 3: The Lazy Controller
- System 2 has a natural speed and expends energy on random thoughts and monitoring without much strain.
- Self-control and cognitive effort are forms of mental work. Studies show people facing both a demanding cognitive task and temptation are more likely to yield to temptation.
- People who are cognitively busy are also more likely to make selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgments in social situations. 
- Self-control is tiring; after forcing yourself to do something, you're less able to exert self-control on the next challenge (ego depletion).
- High-demand System 2 activities require self-control, which is depleting and unpleasant. Ego depletion involves a loss of motivation, making it harder to exert self-control again.
- Stanovich argues that rationality should be distinguished from intelligence.

#### Ch 4: The Associative Machine
- An odd feature is that your System 1 treated the mere conjunction of two words as reality (banana, vomit). Your body reacted as if to the real thing, with emotional and physical responses forming part of the interpretation.
- In the current view of associative memory, an activated idea triggers many others simultaneously, which then activate even more ideas.
- Only a few activated ideas reach consciousness; most associative thinking occurs silently and unconsciously.
- It's hard to accept, but true: you know far less about yourself than you feel you do because much of your mind's workings are hidden from your experience.
- Influencing of an action by the idea—is known as the ideomotor effect. The ideomotor link also works in reverse.
- System 1 provides the impressions that often turn into your beliefs, and is the source of the impulses that often become your choices and your actions. It offers a tacit interpretation of what happens to you and around you, linking the present with the recent past and with expectations about the near future. It is the source of your rapid and often precise intuitive judgments.

#### Ch 5: Cognitive Ease
- One of the dials measures cognitive ease, ranging from "Easy" to "Strained." "Easy" indicates smooth functioning with no threats or major news, requiring no redirection of attention or effort. "Strained" signals a problem, necessitating increased mobilization of System 2.
- A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth.
- The familiarity of one phrase in a statement can make the entire statement feel familiar and true. If you can't remember the source of a statement and can't relate it to other knowledge, you rely on cognitive ease.
- In order to make people to believe you the general principle is that anything you can do to reduce cognitive strain will help, so you should first maximize legibility.
- System 1 can respond to events unknown to System 2. The mere exposure effect is stronger for stimuli never consciously seen by the individual.
- The evidence linking good feelings, cognitive ease, and the intuition of coherence is correlational. Despite this, good feelings do lead to intuitions of coherence.

#### Ch 6: Norms, Surprises, and Causes
- The spreading of activation in the associative machine is automatic, but System 2 has some ability to control the search of memory and to program it so that the detection of an event in the environment can attract attention.
- The main function of System 1 is to maintain and update a model of your personal world, which represents what is normal in it.
- Surprise is essential to our mental life and the most sensitive indicator of our understanding and expectations of the world.
- When something cement does not fit into the current context of activated ideas, the system detects an abnormality, as you just experienced. 
- System 1, which understands language, has access to norms of categories, which specify the range of plausible values as well as the most typical cases.
- Common wisdom held that we infer physical causality from repeated observations of event correlations.
- From birth, we are ready to form impressions of causality without reasoning about patterns of causation; these are products of System 1. 

#### Ch 7: A Machine for Jumping Conclusions
- Jumping to conclusions is efficient if they are likely correct, the cost of mistakes is acceptable, and it saves significant time and effort.
- Jumping to conclusions is risky when the situation is unfamiliar, the stakes are high, and there is no time to collect more information.
- These are the circumstances in which intuitive errors are probable, which may be prevented by a deliberate intervention of System 2.
- In the absence of an explicit context, System 1 generated a likely context on its own.
- When uncertain, System 1 bets on an answer guided by experience. Recent events and the current context weigh most in the interpretation, but if no recent event comes to mind, distant memories take over.
- System 1 does not track rejected alternatives or acknowledge their existence. Conscious doubt, requiring simultaneous incompatible interpretations, is not within System 1's capacity; it demands mental effort. Uncertainty and doubt belong to System 2.
- The moral is significant: when System 2 is busy, we believe almost anything. System 1 is gullible and biased to believe, while System 2 handles doubting and unbelieving, but System 2 is often busy or lazy.
- The tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person—including things you have not observed—is known as the halo effect. 
- To derive the most useful information from multiple sources of evidence, ensure these sources are independent of each other.
- The combination of a coherence-seeking System 1 and a lazy System 2 means that System 2 will endorse many intuitive beliefs that reflect the impressions generated by System 1.
- Overconfidence: Neither the quantity nor the quality of evidence significantly impacts subjective confidence. Additionally, our associative system tends to establish a coherent pattern and suppresses doubt and ambiguity.
- Framing effects: Different ways of presenting the same information often evoke different emotions.
- Base-rate neglect: Statistical fact almost certainly did not come to your mind when you first considered the question. 

#### Ch 8: How Judgments Happen
- System 2 directs attention and searches memory to answer questions, whether they are received or generated.
- System 1 continuously monitors internal and external events, generating effortless, automatic assessments. These basic assessments influence intuitive judgment by substituting for more complex questions, central to the heuristics and biases approach.
- Two other features of System 1 support judgment substitution: the ability to translate values across dimensions. Additionally, the *mental shotgun* effect means that when System 2 intends to answer a specific question or evaluate an attribute, it automatically triggers other computations, including basic assessments.
- System 1, shaped by evolution, provides a continuous assessment of the main problems an organism must solve to survive.
- Good mood and cognitive ease are the human equivalents of assessments of safety and familiarity.
- System 1 understands language, relying on basic assessments during event perception and message comprehension. These include computations of similarity, representativeness, causality attributions, and evaluations of associations and exemplars. These assessments occur even without specific tasks, but their results are used to meet task demands as they arise.
- System 1 carries out many computations at any one time. Some of these are routine assessments that go on continuously. 
- However, control over intended computations is imprecise; we often compute more than necessary. This excess computation is called the *mental shotgun*.

#### Ch 9: Answering an Easier Question
- Heuristic: a simple procedure to find adequate, though often imperfect, answers to difficult questions.
- When judging probability, people often judge something else, believing they've judged probability. System 1 does this when a related, easier heuristic question comes to mind.
- The mental shotgun generates quick answers to difficult questions without burdening lazy System 2.
- Heuristic questions offer an off-the-shelf answer to difficult target questions.
- The mental shotgun and intensity matching provide answers to easy questions that map onto the target question. Sometimes, substitution occurs, and System 2 endorses a heuristic answer. Although System 2 can reject or modify it, a lazy System 2 often endorses the heuristic answer with minimal scrutiny.
- The essential step in the heuristic—substituting three-dimensional for two-dimensional size—occurred automatically.
- The key step in the heuristic—the substitution of three-dimensional for two-dimensional size—occurred automatically.
- The dominance of conclusions over arguments is most pronounced where emotions are involved. 
- Your conclusions aren't fixed; they're open to change with new information and sensible reasoning. Your beliefs and emotions may shift if you learn the risks of an activity you disliked are smaller than you thought.
- Self-criticism is one of the functions of System 2. 
- In the context of attitudes, System 2 tends to justify the emotions of System 1 rather than critically evaluate them, acting more as an endorser than an enforcer.

### Reflections

- Part-I sets the stage for a deeper understanding of human behavior by explaining the dual-system approach. It provides a framework of why we often rely on intuition, and how we misled by it. Understanding the dynamics between System 1 and System 2 can have practical implications in various fields such as marketing, economics, and personal decision-making. The chapter introduces the idea that System 1 is prone to biases and errors because it operates quickly and on the basis of heuristics (mental shortcuts).

#### Ch 10: The Law of Small Numbers

- System 1 is highly adept in one form of thinking, automatically and effortlessly identifying causal connections between events, sometimes even when the connection is spurious.
- Large samples are more precise than small samples. Small samples yield extreme results more often than large samples do.
- A machine for jumping to conclusions will act as if it believed in the law of small numbers and produce a representation of reality that makes too much sense.
- The exaggerated faith in small samples is one example of a broader illusion: we focus more on the content of messages than their reliability, leading to a simpler and more coherent view of the world than the data justify. Jumping to conclusions is safer in our imagination than in reality.
- Statistics produce many observations that seem to beg for causal explanations but do not support them. Many facts are due to chance, including sampling accidents. Causal explanations of chance events are inevitably wrong.
