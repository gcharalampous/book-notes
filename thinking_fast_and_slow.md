## Part 1: Two systems

### Summary

[Write a brief summary of the chapter here]

### Key Points
#### Ch 1: The Characters of the Story
- System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control.
- System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.
- System 2 can modify System 1 by programming attention and memory.
- System 1 operates automatically, while System 2 typically works in a low-effort mode.
- System 1 generates suggestions for System 2, which can become beliefs or actions if endorsed.
- System 1 calls on System 2 for detailed processing when needed.
- System 2 monitors behavior, maintaining politeness when angry and alertness while driving.
- System 2 is too slow to replace System 1 but can help avoid mistakes when necessary.

#### Ch 2: The Characters of the Story
- Pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort.
- System 2 can adopt "task sets" to override habitual responses.
- The most effortful slow thinking requires fast thinking.

#### Ch 3: The Lazy Controller
- System 2 has a natural speed and expends energy on random thoughts and monitoring without much strain.
- Self-control and cognitive effort are forms of mental work. Studies show people facing both a demanding cognitive task and temptation are more likely to yield to temptation.
- People who are cognitively busy are also more likely to make selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgments in social situations. 
- Self-control is tiring; after forcing yourself to do something, you're less able to exert self-control on the next challenge (ego depletion).
- High-demand System 2 activities require self-control, which is depleting and unpleasant. Ego depletion involves a loss of motivation, making it harder to exert self-control again.
- Stanovich argues that rationality should be distinguished from intelligence.
