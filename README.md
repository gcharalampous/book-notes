## Introduction

Reading books is a great way to gain knowledge, explore new ideas, and see the world from different perspectives. This repository contains my personal notes and reflections on the books I have read.

## Why Share Notes?

1. **Retention**: Writing notes helps reinforce the key concepts and ideas.
2. **Sharing Knowledge**: Others can benefit from the insights and summaries, saving them time or encouraging them to read the book.
3. **Community Building**: Engaging with others who have read the same books or are interested in them.

## How to Use This Repository

Each book has its own folder containing notes in markdown format. The notes are organized by chapter or section, with key points, quotes, and personal reflections. Feel free to browse through the notes, leave comments, or suggest additional insights.
