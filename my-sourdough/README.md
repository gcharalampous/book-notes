# 😂 **My Ridiculously Overcomplicated Sourdough Bread Recipe** 🍞

## **Ingredients**

- **150g [sourdough starter](sourdough_starter.md)** (AKA your new pet that you'll need to feed more regularly than your goldfish)
- **600g of high-protein (strong) bread flour** (also known as “the kind that didn’t skip leg day”)
- **150g of whole-wheat bread flour** (because regular flour just wasn’t feeling whole enough).
- **525g of water** (lukewarm – because your dough deserves a spa day, not an ice bath or a hot tub party)
- **10g-to-15g of salt** (the only ingredient with a personality in this whole dough)



## **Instructions**

### 1. **Prepare Your Sourdough Starter**
   - If you had the pleasure of meeting me in person, I might have shared some of my sourdough starter with you. If not, unlucky for you, but at least I am providing instructions on how to create your own **[sourdough starter](sourdough_starter.md)**.
   - Feed it every day like it’s a Tamagotchi from the ‘90s. I used to have one of those! If it dies, it’s on you, just kidding! You can actually feed it once a week and keep it in the refrigerator.
   - Before you start baking, let the sourdough starter come to room temperature, discard half of it, and feed it. It should be bubbling and doubling in size in about 4-6 hours. If not, it’s time for a heart-to-heart chat with your starter.

### 2. **Mixing the Dough**
   - **In a large bowl,** mix the **600g strong flour** and the **150g whole wheat bread flour** together.
   - **Sprinkle 13g of salt** over the dough. Pretend you are seasoning a fancy dish on a cooking show or channel your inner Salt Bae and imagine you are seasoning a golden steak! 
   - Work the salt into the dough until it’s evenly distributed. It might feel like giving a massage to a reluctant cat like Maple.
   - **Add 150g of your overly coddled sourdough starter** with **525g of water**. Mix until a shaggy mess forms. It should look like something you found under your bed after a month of avoiding chores.
   - **Continue mixing for 3-5 minutes**. Things can get sticky in this step, kind of like trying to leave a party when your favorite song comes on!
   - Cover the bowl with a damp towel and **let it rest** for 20 minutes. The dough needs a nap, and so do you. You have done so much up to this step.


### 3. **The Stretch and Fold**
   - This step will make you look like a pro or just someone who’s playing with their food.
   - **Every 15 minutes** for the **next 1 hour**, stretch and fold the dough. Pretend you’re doing some fancy yoga moves. 🧘‍♂️
   - Cover the dough with a damp towel between each session. It’s important to let it think about its life choices.

### 4. **The Bulk Fermentation**
   - Let the dough sit undisturbed for 6-8 hours to room temperature until it increases by 50% in size (that is not double!!). It's like watching paint dry, but doughier.
   - **Tip:** If you’re impatient, try meditating. If that fails, Netflix has some great shows. If that also fails, try some local shows but in any case avoid watching the news!

### 5. **Shaping the Dough**
   - After the bulk fermentation, split the dough into two equal parts! Cover with a damp towel, and let it rest for 20 minute on the counter.
   - Gently shape your dough into a round ball. Use the bulls-eye technique. If it’s more blob than ball, just go with it.
   - Place it in a well-floured proofing basket, flip it upside down, and cover it with a towel. Tell it a bedtime story.

### 6. **Final Proof**
   - Let the dough rest in the fridge overnight. It's basically on a spa retreat, so let it chill (literally).

### 7. **Baking Time!**
   - Preheat your oven to **450°F (230°C)** with a Dutch oven inside. The hotter, the better ! ! !
   - Gently turn your dough onto a piece of parchment paper. If it sticks, well… we warned you about that flour.
   - Score the top with a sharp knife. This is your dough’s “I’m ready for the oven” tattoo.
   - Carefully place it in the hot Dutch oven, cover it with the lid, and bake for **25 minutes**.
   - After 25 minutes, remove the lid and bake for an additional **15-20 minutes** until the crust is golden brown and your kitchen smells like a bakery.

### 8. **Cooling**
   - Let the bread cool completely on a wire rack before slicing. Or don’t. Who are we to judge your life choices? No, but seriously, suppress your urges and let it rest of a least an hour :) 

### 9. **Enjoy!**
   - Slice, slather with butter, and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Don’t forget to pair it with your favorite cheese, like Halloumi from Cyprus!!!
   - **Warning:** Sharing with others might make them demand you bake more, so proceed with caution.
