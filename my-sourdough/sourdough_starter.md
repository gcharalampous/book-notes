# ðŸŒ± **How to Create a Sourdough Starter** ðŸ¥–

## **Ingredients**

- **Whole-grain flour** (like rye or whole wheat for that extra oomph)
- **Water** (filtered or bottled if your tap water is heavily chlorinated)

## **Day 1: The Birth of Your Starter**
1. **Mix the Ingredients:**
   - In a clean jar, combine **25g of whole-grain flour**, and **25g of bread flour** with **50g of water**. Stir until itâ€™s the consistency of a thick pancake batter.
   - Scrape down the sides of the jar and loosely cover it with a lid or a cloth. This is your starterâ€™s cozy little nursery.
   
2. **Let it Rest:**
   - Leave the jar at room temperature, ideally between 70Â°F and 75Â°F (21Â°C and 24Â°C). 
   - Your starter will sit there for 24 hours, getting used to its new environment, while you pretend not to check on it every 5 minutes :) 

## **Day 2: A Little Tender Loving Care**
1. **Check for Bubbles:**
   - You may see a few bubbles forming. If you do, give yourself a pat on the back! If not, donâ€™t worry at all. Some starters are just late bloomers; it all depends on the environmental conditions and flour protein concentration.
   
2. **Feed Your Starter:**
   - Add **50g (25g whole wheat + 25g bread flour)** and **50g of water** to the remaining mixture. Stir well, cover, and let it rest for another 24 hours. You should have in total 200g of sourdough starter by now.
  
## **Day 3-5: Nurturing the Beast**
1. **Bubble Watch:**
   - By now, you should see more bubbles, and your starter might start smelling a bit sour or fruity. This is good news! If it smells funky, hang in there; itâ€™s just going through a phase :)
   
2. **Twice Daily Feedings:**
   - Discard half of the mixture (around 50g). Itâ€™s a bit like pruning a plant, you are simply making room for new growth. 
   - Use **50g of flour** and **50g of water** each time. Stir, cover, and let it continue to ferment.
 3. **Repeat the discard and feed process**
     - Repeat steps 1-to-3 every 12 hours (morning and night).

## **Day 6-7: Ready for Action**
1. **Final Countdown:**
   - Your starter should be doubling in size within 4-6 hours after feeding, full of bubbles, and have a pleasant, tangy smell. If so, congratulations, youâ€™ve raised a healthy starter!
   
2. **The Float Test (Optional):**
   - Drop a teaspoon of your starter into a glass of water. If it floats, itâ€™s ready to bake with. If it sinks, give it another day or two of feeding.

3. **Storage:**
   - If youâ€™re not baking right away, you can store your starter in the fridge and feed it once a week. When youâ€™re ready to bake, bring it back to room temperature and feed it a couple of times to wake it up.

## **Naming Your Starter (Optional but Fun!)**
- Give your starter a name because, at this point, it's practically family. 
- Mine is called 'kokisimo' - if you are not a Cypriot, you won't understand!
  
Now you're all set with a sourdough starter thatâ€™s ready to help you bake delicious bread!
